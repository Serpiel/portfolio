        <h1>What is Serpiel ?</h1>
        <div class="content-container">
            <p>
                First as an username, Serpiel became an identity on internet. <br>
                Launched to represent the art of music but also the liberty to do whatever you want.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, Serpiel evolved beyond a simple name — it's a mindset, a way of creating without limits. Whether in sound, design, or vision, it stands for freedom, authenticity, and passion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Serpiel is not just a name — it's a brand. A symbol of artistic independence, a digital signature for bold creations, and a platform where ideas turn into projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through music, visuals, and now an e-commerce universe, Serpiel is carving its own path — far from the mainstream, close to the soul.
            </p>
            <p>
                Welcome to the world of Serpiel. Create. Express. Be free.
